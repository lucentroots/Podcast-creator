# Hinglish Prompting Strategy (100-word Explanation)

To achieve natural Hinglish, I structured the prompt with three key elements:

1. **Explicit Code-Switching Instructions**: I instructed the LLM to naturally mix Hindi and English words as real Indian speakers do, avoiding forced translations.

2. **Cultural Context**: I included examples showing natural Hinglish patterns (e.g., "Yaar, Mumbai Indians ka performance...") so the model understands the conversational style.

3. **Natural Speech Markers**: I explicitly requested interruptions ("umm", "achcha", "yaar"), agreement phrases ("haan", "bilkul", "exactly"), and laughter markers to make it sound conversational rather than scripted.

The temperature was set to 0.8 to encourage natural variation, and I used GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency while maintaining quality. The key was providing concrete examples rather than abstract instructions.
